      <h2>Investment Thesis</h2>
      <p>We invest in people — not paper. If it’s not something we build internally, it’s a founder we believe in completely.</p>
      <p>We back individuals with extreme conviction, deep domain insight, or the kind of obsessive determination that can’t be taught. Degrees don’t matter. Résumés don’t matter. What matters is fire, vision, and grit.</p>
      <p>We built Mawji Holdings by thinking unconventionally, refusing to compromise what we believe in, and never quitting. We back people who operate the same way — rebels, builders, and relentless founders solving problems the world has ignored or abandoned.</p>
      <p>We believe in blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies — especially Bitcoin. It’s one of the most important movements of our lifetime. Microtransactions, on-chain settlement, financial transparency, and privacy-preserving control are foundational to the future we're betting on.</p>
      <p>We believe the way data is stored, accessed, and monetized will return to the hands of the individual. Security and privacy tools will define the next era — especially as governments and corporations collaborate more aggressively to centralize control.</p>
      <p>We exist to fund those fighting that future — and to back those building something that outlives them. Something that ensures the future doesn’t look like 1984.</p>
